            <h2>Summary Of Bhagat Singh's Journey</h2>
            <h3> ● Early life and education</h3>
            <p>
                ➢ Bhagat Singh was born on 27 September 1907 in the village of Banga in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what was then British India and is today Pakistan; he was the second of seven children—four sons, and three daughters—born to Vidyavati and
                her husband Kishan Singh Sandhu. Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle Ajit Singh were active in progressive politics, taking part in the agitation around the Canal Colonization Bill in 1907, and later the Ghadar Movement of 1914–1915.
                <br> <br> ➢ After being sent to the village school in Banga for a few years, Bhagat Singh was enrolled in the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic School in Lahore. In 1923, he joined the National College in Lahore, founded two years earlier by Lala Lajpat
                Rai in response to Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement, which urged Indian students to shun schools and colleges subsidized by the British Indian government. Police became concerned with Singh's influence on youths and arrested him
                in May 1927 on the pretext that he had been involved in a bombing that had taken place in Lahore in October 1926. <br> <br> ➢ He was released on a surety of Rs. 60,000 five weeks after his arrest. He wrote for, and edited, Urdu and Punjabi
                newspapers, published in Amritsar and also contributed to low-priced pamphlets published by the Naujawan Bharat Sabha that excoriated the British. He also wrote for Kirti, the journal of the Kirti Kisan Party ("Workers and Peasants Party")
                and briefly for the Veer Arjun newspaper, published in Delhi. He often used pseudonyms, including names such as Balwant, Ranjit and Vidhrohi.
            </p>
            <h3> ● Career as a freedom fighter</h3>
            <p>
                ➢ Bhagat Singh read many articles about the European nationalist movements. Hence he was very much inspired by the same in 1925. He founded the Naujavan Bharat Sabha for his national movement. Later he joined the Hindustan Republican Association where
                he came in contact with a number of prominent revolutionaries like Sukhdev, Rajguru and Chandrashekhar Azad.<br><br> ➢ He also began contributing articles for the Kirti Kisan Party’s magazine. Although his parents wanted
                him to marry at that time, he rejected this proposal. He said to them that he wanted to dedicate his life to the freedom struggle completely.<br><br> ➢ Due to this involvement in various revolutionary activities, he became a person of
                interest for the British police. Hence police arrested him in May 1927. After a few months, he was released from the jail and again he involved himself in writing revolutionary articles for newspapers.<br><br>

            <h3>● The Turning Point for Bhagat Singh </h3>
            <p>
                ➢ The British government held the Simon Commission in 1928 to discuss autonomy for the Indians. But It was boycotted by several political organizations because this commission did not include any Indian representative.<br><br> ➢ Lala Lajpat
                Rai protested against the same and lead a procession and march towards the Lahore station. Police used the Lathi charge to control the mob. Because of Lathi charge police brutally hit the protestors. Lala Lajpat Rai got seriously injured
                and he was hospitalized. After few weeks Lala Ji became shaheed.<br><br> ➢ This incident left Bhagat Singh enraged and therefore he planned to take revenge of Lala Ji’s death. Hence, he killed British police officer John P. Saunders soon
                after. Later he and his associates bombed the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi. Police arrested them, and Bhagat Singh confessed his involvement in the incident.<br><br>

            </p>
            <h3>● Death</h3>
            <p>
                ➢ The time of execution was fixed in the morning on 24 March 1931. But on 23 March at 7:33 pm, the British government hung them against the rules a day before. Saying “Mera Rang De Basanti Chola”, the freedom fighter swung on the gallows with Sukhdev
                and Rajguru. The British government burnt his body on the banks of the Sutlej.
